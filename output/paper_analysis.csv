"Signature generation and detection of malware families","Sathyanarayan V.S.; Kohli P.; Bruhadeshwar B.","2008","Malware detection and prevention is critical for the protection of computing systems across the Internet. The problem in detecting malware is that they evolve over a period of time and hence, traditional signature-based malware detectors fail to detect obfuscated and previously unseen malware executables. However, as malware evolves, some semantics of the original malware are preserved as these semantics are necessary for the effectiveness of the malware. Using this observation, we present a nov...","10.1007/978-3-540-70500-0_25","98","","","Stack Analysis; Static Analysis; IRC Analysis; Taint Analysis"
"Malware Examiner using Disassembled Code (MEDiC)","Sulaiman A.; Ramamoorthy K.; Mukkamala S.; Sung A.H.","2005","Current static malware detection techniques have serious limitations, and sandbox testing also fails to provide a complete solution due to time constraints. In this paper, we present a robust assembly language signature-based malware detection technique, with emphasis on detecting obfuscated (or polymorphic) malware and mutated (or metamorphic) malware. The hypothesis is that all versions of the same malware share a common core signature that is a combination of several features of the code. Aft...","10.1109/IAW.2005.1495985","6","","","Disassembly"

The term 'Malware' is collectively used for viruses, worms, Trojan's etc. Malicious activities of malware is to steal, modify, leak the data to external server or consuming system resources thereby degrading the performance of system. To avoid detection, malicious code(s) generates multiple variants while they propagate.

"Data mining methods for malware detection using instruction sequences","Siddiqui M.; Wang M.C.; Lee J.","2008","Malicious programs pose a serious threat to computer security. Traditional approaches using signatures to detect malicious programs pose little danger to new and unseen programs whose signatures are not available. The focus of the research is shifting fromusing signature patterns to identify a specific malicious program and/or its variants to discover the general malicious behavior in the programs. This paper presents a novel idea of automatically identifying critical instruction sequences that ...","","38","","","Stack Analysis; Static Analysis; Logistic Regression; Progressive Neural Networks; IRC Analysis"

"Using the danger model of immune systems for distributed defense in modern data networks","Swimmer M.","2007","This paper represents a departure from the current paradigms of centralized attack defenses and introduces the idea of the Danger model to autonomic defense systems. In existing systems, such as anti-viruses (AV) or intrusion prevention systems (IPS), a central authority generates the defense mechanisms and deploys these to the systems in the field. While this strategy works fairly well in static systems, currently the trend is towards large and more dynamically configured systems. The future is...","10.1016/j.comnet.2006.09.015","35","","",""

The bot writers have developed a variety of techniques to evade simple signature-based detection. Concise representations of malware behavior, or semantic patterns, are much harder to evade or obfuscate. However, generating a semantic pattern for every program instance is time-consuming, and comparing with a large number of patterns creates a challenge for timely identification ...","10.1109/COMPSAC.2010.33","18","","","Static Analysis; Signature-based Detection; Edge Detection; Hierarchical Clustering"
"Nozzle: A defense against heap-spraying code injection attacks","Ratanaworabhan P.; Livshits B.; Zorn B.","2009","Heap spraying is a security attack that increases the ex-ploitability of memory corruption errors in type-unsafe applications. In a heap-spraying attack, an attacker coerces an application to allocate many objects containing malicious code in the heap, increasing the success rate of an exploit that jumps to a location within the heap. Because heap layout randomization necessitates new forms of attack, spraying has been used in many recent security exploits. Spraying is especially effective in we...","","160","","","Static Analysis; Code Injection"
